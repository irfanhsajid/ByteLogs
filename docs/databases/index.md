# Databases

Learn how to work with different types of databases for your applications.

## Database Types

### SQL Databases (Relational)

Structured data with predefined schemas and relationships:

- **[PostgreSQL](database/postgresql.md)** - Advanced features, JSON support
- **[MySQL](database/mysql.md)** - Fast, reliable, widely supported

### NoSQL Databases

Flexible schemas for evolving data structures:

- **[MongoDB](database/mongodb.md)** - Document-oriented database

## Choosing a Database

### Use PostgreSQL When:
- You need advanced SQL features
- JSON support is required
- ACID compliance is critical
- Complex queries and joins are common

### Use MySQL When:
- You need a simple, fast database
- Building web applications
- Read-heavy workloads
- Wide hosting support needed

### Use MongoDB When:
- Schema flexibility is important
- Working with JSON-like documents
- Horizontal scaling is required
- Rapid development with changing requirements
